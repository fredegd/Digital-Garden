# From Doodles to Code: My Unconventional Journey

Hey there, fellow adventurers in the digital realm! Today, I'm excited to share with you the wild ride that led me from doodles and dreams to a world filled with lines of code and boundless creativity. So, grab your favorite beverage, get cozy, and let's dive into the story of how it all began.

Picture this: a few years back, I found myself yearning to make some dazzling drawings using a nifty pen plotter I had just built from scratch. Little did I know that this innocent desire would send me hurtling into the fascinating universe of coding. It turns out, pen plotters hunger for vector data, the kind that makes them waltz gracefully across the canvas, turning abstract shapes into tangible art. Problem was, I didn't have the foggiest idea of how to produce these mystical "drawings."

But you know what they say - necessity is the mother of invention. Armed with determination and Google as my trusty sidekick, I began my quest. The internet was a treasure trove of knowledge, but it also felt like a labyrinth filled with cryptic black images, code, commands, and peculiar languages. I admit; I was slightly terrified at first. Who wouldn't be when faced with this digital maze? Yet, there was something undeniably alluring about it.

Day by day, click by click, I plunged deeper into this enigmatic world. Along the way, I stumbled upon a coding gem known as **Processing**. This marvelous tool offered a direct route to crafting code commands and functions in Java (and hey, there were extensions for other languages too). It could execute those commands, morphing them into mesmerizing creations right before your eyes on a virtual canvas. Imagine my joy when I uncovered this digital elixir!

As I journeyed onward, I had an epiphany: coding was nothing more than a sophisticated way of conversing with machines. The magic lay in how we crafted our sentences (code) to make these digital creatures perform our bidding. And just like that, the fear began to fade, replaced by an insatiable curiosity and excitement.

Now, for all you budding coders out there, let me tell you, there are countless tutorials on the web. But the ones that truly stole my heart (and continue to do so) belong to the **Coding Train** and **TRCC**. These virtual mentors introduced me to the thrilling realm of creative coding and the warm embrace of their communities.

Here's where our story takes a twist. This awakening happened during the tumultuous year of 2021, while I juggled my job in the food industry as a vendor and my secret life as a coffee specialist, hosting workshops for aspiring baristas.

Perhaps it was the caffeine coursing through my veins, but I often found myself in front of the computer after work, and even late into the night, learning the art of coding from scratch. My mission? Crafting applications that birthed captivating geometric patterns (remember the pen plotter?). It's safe to say I fell head over heels for this newfound passion, feeling much like one does when they experience their first crush - that electric mix of trepidation and elation.

With each line of code, I discovered that this digital alchemy had a purpose. Those seemingly endless strings of characters weren't just lines; they were blueprints for crafting entire universes. Thanks to the supportive creative coding community, I uncovered the joy of creating not only vector drawings but also video, motion graphics, music, and a cornucopia of other digital marvels. It was a thrilling ride that I couldn't resist.

Fast forward to 2022, and Tim extended an invitation that would forever change my trajectory. I was invited to join one of his mesmerizing workshops, where we spent a day turning Bach's Prelude in C into a visual masterpiece. The results? Nothing short of amazing.

Not long after, I had the opportunity to participate in an international digital art exhibition in the Netherlands. The realization hit me like a ton of pixels - I needed to pivot my career and pursue what I genuinely loved. The stars aligned when I stumbled upon the **WBS coding school**, and it struck me like lightning - the hybrid **Web Dev Bootcamp** was the path to follow.

Four and a half months of intensive learning, daily lectures, coding challenges, and exercises, all infused with **AGILE methodologies**, transformed me. I emerged as a coding wizard, ready to make my mark in the industry.

Today, as I put the finishing touches on this website, I look back on this journey with fondness. From doodles to code, it's been a rollercoaster of self-discovery, creativity, and an unyielding passion for turning lines into art. So, here's to the unexpected twists, the chance encounters, and the code that brought it all to life. Cheers to the creative coder in all of us!

Thanks for joining me on this adventure. Until next time, keep coding, keep creating, and keep your creative spirit soaring high!
